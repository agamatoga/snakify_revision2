'''

The important thing with Python is that when we get an input() we get the input as a String and so we have to
convert it if we're doing things with Integer values like "sum."

Thus, when getting the input here we convert explicitly to int()
'''


i1 = int(input())
i2 = int(input())
i3 = int(input())

print(i1 + i2 + i3)
